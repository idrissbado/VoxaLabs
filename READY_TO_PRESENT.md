## 🚀 Your Message (Distilled)

### **The Headline:**
> "AI Math Teacher for Africa - Solving the Teacher Shortage Crisis with Real Teaching, Not Just Answers"

### **The Problem:**
> "In Ivory Coast, there are fewer qualified math teachers per student than anywhere else in Africa. Students struggle alone. We solve this."

### **The Solution:**
> "PrepCoach is an AI teacher that guides students through problem-solving, validates every step, and teaches understanding - not just answers."

### **The Innovation:**
> "Multi-format submission (photos, PDFs, LaTeX), specialized math AI (MathΣtral), and pedagogy that mirrors real teaching."

### **The Impact:**
> "Students complete homework AND learn. Teachers focus on teaching. Families don't need to afford tutors. Education access becomes equal."
