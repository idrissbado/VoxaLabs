# 🎬 PrepCoach Demo - "AI Math Teacher for Africa"

**For: Students, Teachers, Investors, Impact Advocates**  
**Duration:** 5 minutes | **Goal:** Show how this solves the math education crisis

---

## 🎯 The Problem (0:00-0:30)

> "In Ivory Coast, there are fewer qualified math teachers per student than anywhere in Africa.
>
> A student faces Friday homework with no help, no tutor, no one to explain.
> They get stuck. They give up. They fail.
>
> This is the problem we're solving."

*[Show stat on screen or have written]*
- 1-2 math teachers per secondary school
- Families can't afford private tutors
- Rural areas have virtually zero access to help
- Result: Math failures, missed opportunities, limited futures

---

## ✨ The Solution (0:30-1:00)

> "Meet PrepCoach - an AI math teacher available 24/7, in your pocket, for free.
>
> Not just an answer app. A real teacher that:
> - Understands your problem
> - Guides you to discover the answer
> - Validates every step
> - Explains why mistakes happened
> - Works with any format: text, photos, PDFs"

>
> Why? Because students might:
> - Have a textbook problem to photograph
> - Have a PDF handout from school
> - Have LaTeX from a university document
> - Just want to type it
>
> We handle all of it."

### **1.3 Demo Typing**

*[Type: "Solve for x: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0"]*

> "Let me start with typing. A simple quadratic equation - the kind students struggle with."

### **1.4 Demo Image Upload (if available)**

*[Or describe:]*

> "Or - imagine a student photographing a textbook problem.
> They don't have to retype. Our system extracts the text automatically using OCR.
> Works with JPG, PNG, even blurry phone photos."

### **1.5 Click Start Solving**

*[Click "Start Solving"]*

> "Now watch what happens..."

>
> 💭 It hints at the approach
> 🎯 It suggests strategy
> 📋 It breaks it into steps
> ⚠️ It warns about common mistakes
>
> This is teaching. Not just answering."

---

## ✏️ DEMO PART 3: Step-by-Step Solving with Validation (3:00-4:00)

### **3.1 Solve Step 1**

*[Enter first step toward solution]*

### **3.2 Show Step Validation**

*[Show feedback]*

> "The AI checks:
> - Is the algebra correct?
> - Is the reasoning sound?
> - Are you applying the right concepts?
>
> If correct: 'Good! Next step...'
> If wrong: 'Not quite. Think about...' [with hint]
>
> Real teachers do this. Now students without teachers can get it."

### **3.3 Complete the Solution**

*[Walk through remaining steps quickly]*

---

## 🎓 DEMO PART 5: Why This Matters (4:30-5:00)

> "Let me step back. This is bigger than one homework problem.
>
> **Think about a student's week:**
>
> Monday: Gets homework
> Tuesday-Thursday: Stuck on problems, doesn't ask for help (too shy, too embarrassed)
> Friday: Submits incomplete homework
> Monday: Gets it back with bad grade, no explanation
> Result: Repeats same mistakes on test
>
> **WITH PrepCoach:**
>
> Monday: Gets homework
> Tuesday-Thursday: Stuck on a problem? Take photo, get helped, understand it
> Friday: Submits complete homework AND learned the concept
> Monday: Gets good grade, understands test will be similar
> Result: Passes test, keeps learning
>
> **Multiply this:**
> - 20 students in a class
> - 4 math classes per school
> - 100 schools in a region
> - Thousands of students actually learning
>
> That's lives changed."
