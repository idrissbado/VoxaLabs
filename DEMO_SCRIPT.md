# 🎬 VoxaLab AI - Demo Script for Loom

**Duration:** 3-5 minutes | **Audience:** Technical, Product, Educators

---

## 🎯 Demo Flow (Copy-Paste Ready)

### **OPENING (0:00-0:15)**

*[Show dashboard with both Interview Coach and Math Tutor cards]*

> "Welcome to **VoxaLab AI** - an intelligent coaching platform that uses advanced AI to help you master two critical skills: **technical interviews** and **advanced mathematics**.
>
> Today I'll show you two powerful features powered by **Mistral's latest AI models** - including the specialized math reasoning engine called **MathΣtral**."

---

## 📚 **PART 1: INTERVIEW COACH (0:15-1:45)**

### **1.1 Select Interview Coach**

*[Click on Interview Coach card]*

> "Let's start with the Interview Coach. Here you can practice any technical role - Backend, Frontend, DevOps, Data Science, or Product Management."

### **1.2 Select Role & Question**

*[Select "Backend Engineer" → Choose a question like "Design a URL Shortener"]*

> "I'll select Backend Engineer and get a challenging system design question: 'Design a URL Shortener like bit.ly'."

### **1.3 Two Input Methods**

*[Hover over input area showing both 🎤 and ⌨️ icons]*

> "Notice we have two ways to answer:
> - **🎤 Voice Recording** - Record your answer and Whisper AI transcribes it in real-time
> - **⌨️ Text Input** - Type your answer directly
>
> I'll use text for this demo, but in real use, voice is ideal for simulating the actual interview."

### **1.4 Submit Answer**

*[Type a solid backend answer, click Submit]*

> "I'll provide a comprehensive answer covering the problem statement, system requirements, architecture design, and tradeoffs..."

### **1.5 AI Analysis in Progress**

*[Show the "🤖 Analyzing..." loading state]*

> "Now the AI analyzes my answer using **Mistral Large 3** for intelligent evaluation."

### **1.6 Get Performance Scores**

*[Wait for scores to appear]*

> "The system provides three key scores:
> - **Clarity Score** (0-10) - How well I communicated
> - **Structure Score** (0-10) - Logical organization of my answer
> - **Impact Score** (0-10) - Demonstrated business value and scalability
>
> Plus detailed feedback on strengths, areas for improvement, and coaching tips."

*[Show STAR analysis if available]*

> "It also provides STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) analysis and suggestions for next steps."

## 🧮 **PART 2: ADVANCED MATH TUTOR (1:45-4:00)**

### **2.1 Enter Math Tutor**

*[Click on Math Tutor card]*

> "Now let's explore the **Advanced Math Tutor** - powered by **MathΣtral**, a specialized mathematical AI.
>
> MathΣtral is different from regular AI - it's specifically trained for rigorous math reasoning across Linear Algebra, Calculus, Differential Equations, Abstract Algebra, and more."

### **2.2 Multi-Format Problem Submission**

*[Show the two input tabs]*

> "Here's the game-changer: you can submit math problems in **any format**:
> - **📝 Type Problem** - Enter directly
> - **📸 Upload Files** - Images (JPG/PNG), PDFs, or LaTeX files"

### **2.2a Option 1: Type Problem Directly**

*[Click "Type Problem" tab, type: "Solve for x: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0"]*

> "I can type the problem directly. Let me enter a quadratic equation."

### **2.2b Option 2: Upload as Image (OCR)**

*[If you have it: Upload a photo of a math problem]*

> "Or I can upload a **photo** of the problem - maybe from a textbook or whiteboard. The system uses Tesseract OCR to automatically extract the text."

*[Alternative: Describe the feature]*

> "Our system extracts the problem using OCR, so handwritten or textbook math becomes digital instantly."

### **2.2c Option 3: Upload PDF**

> "PDF files work too - whether it's a scanned document or a text-based PDF. We automatically extract or OCR the content."

### **2.2d Option 4: Upload LaTeX**

> "If you have a `.tex` file with LaTeX notation, upload it directly - we preserve all mathematical formatting."

### **2.3 Problem Analysis by MathΣtral**

*[Click "Start Solving"]*

> "Once we submit, **MathΣtral analyzes** the problem and tells us:
> - **Topic** - What area of math (e.g., Quadratic Equations)
> - **Subtopic** - Specific concept (e.g., Factoring Method)
> - **Difficulty** - 1-5 star rating
> - **Key Concepts** - What we need to know to solve it"

*[Show the Problem Analysis panel]*

### **2.4 Automatic Hint System**

*[Show the green hint box]*

> "Here's something special: **Automatic Hints** appear that guide your thinking WITHOUT spoiling the answer.
>
> The hint uses:
> - 💭 **Hint** - General guidance
> - 🎯 **Strategy** - Suggested approach
> - 📋 **Steps** - Breaking it into parts
> - ⚠️ **Warnings** - Common mistakes to avoid
>
> The AI calibrates difficulty - easier problems get step-by-step guidance, harder ones are more abstract."

### **2.5 Student Solving with Validation**

*[Enter solving steps one by one]*

> "Now I enter my solving steps. After each step, **MathΣtral validates**:
> - Is the algebra correct?
> - Is the logic sound?
> - Did I apply the right concepts?
>
> If it's wrong, it gives feedback without revealing the answer."

*[Enter correct steps]*

> "For each correct step, the hint automatically refreshes for the next part of the problem."

### **2.6 Complete Solution Display**

*[Complete all steps to see full solution]*

> "Once complete, we see the full solution with:
> - Step-by-step explanation
> - LaTeX mathematical notation (publication quality)
> - Why each step works
> - Conceptual insights"

### **2.7 Download in Multiple Formats**

*[Show the 4 download buttons]*

> "And here's the powerful part - **download the solution in any format**:
>
> - 📝 **Markdown** - For notes and documents
> - 📐 **LaTeX** - For academic papers and theses
> - 🌐 **HTML** - For web display and sharing
> - 📊 **JSON** - For data import and automation
>
> *[Click one to demo download]*
>
> This makes it perfect for students, educators, and researchers."
