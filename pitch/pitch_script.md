# VoiceCoach AI — Investor Pitch Script

## Slide 1: HOOK (30 seconds)
"Raise your hand if you've ever bombed a job interview you were qualified for.
That's the problem we're solving. And we built a solution in 4 hours."

---

## Slide 2: THE PROBLEM

- 75 million people apply for jobs every year in the US
- 1 in 3 qualified candidates fail interviews due to communication, not competence
- Mock interview coaching costs $150-$300/hour
- Most people practice alone with zero feedback — and wonder why they don't improve

**The result:** A massive skills gap between talent and opportunity.

---

## Slide 3: THE SOLUTION

**VoiceCoach AI** — The world's first real-time AI interview coach that listens, understands, and coaches like a senior recruiter.

- Speak your answer
- Get instant voice feedback on clarity, structure, confidence, and relevance
- See a live score across 5 dimensions
- Get an end-of-session coaching report

*Demo the app here.*

## Slide 4: THE TECHNOLOGY

Built on **Voxtral-Realtime** by Mistral AI.

Unlike text-based tools, Voxtral hears:
- Filler words ("um", "uh", "like")
- Pacing and hesitation
- Tone and confidence signals

Combined with **Mistral Large 3** for deep contextual coaching intelligence.

This is not a chatbot. This is a coach.

## Demo Script (2 minutes)

1. Open VoiceCoach AI (already loaded on laptop/phone)
2. Select "Software Engineer"
3. Read the question: "Tell me about a time you solved a complex problem"
4. Give a deliberately flawed answer with some "um"s and no clear result
5. Show the live score card updating
6. Read the AI feedback out loud
7. Give a second attempt with STAR structure
8. Show the improved score
9. Navigate to the report page

**Key lines to say during demo:**
- "Notice how it detected my filler words in real time"
- "The STAR method tracker shows exactly where my answer was weak"
- "This is what a $300/hour coach tells you — for $19 a month"
